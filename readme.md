# Sinatra JSON API Example

This is a very small example app showing how to accept and return JSON as an
API. An app like this could serve as a back end for a mobile app or a
[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) app, or any other web interface that relies
on AJAX requests to view and change data.

If you're new to Sinatra I'd recommend starting with my [Sinatra Heroku
Template](https://github.com/stevenklise/Sinatra-Heroku-Template) repository.
